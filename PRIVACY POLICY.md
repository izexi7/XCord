Your privacy is important to us. It is XCord's policy to respect your privacy and comply with any applicable law and regulation regarding any personal information we may collect about you, including across our Discord server https://discord.gg/5YGJvZ2fh3.

This policy is effective as of 7 July 2024 and was last updated on 7 July 2024.

## Information We Collect

Our discord bot does not collect any personally identifing information along with the medias that are downloaded. Messages sent in servers are monitored, but no logs of messages are kept and we will never keep any logs of this type.

## Children's Privacy
We do not aim any of our products or services directly at children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information about children under 13.

## International Transfers of Personal Information
The personal information we collect is stored and/or processed where we or our partners, affiliates, and third-party providers maintain facilities. Please be aware that the locations to which we store, process, or transfer your personal information may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. We will never transfer your data to any other third party, domestically or internationally.

## Your Rights and Controlling Your Personal Information
You always retain the right to withhold personal information from us, with the understanding that your experience of our website may be affected.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights over your personal information. If you do provide us with personal information you understand that we will collect, hold, use and disclose it in accordance with this privacy policy. You retain the right to request details of any personal information we hold about you. To request our bot and website to stop processing any of your data, please contact us at the details in this privacy policy.

If you believe that any information we hold about you is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant, or misleading, please contact us using the details provided in this privacy policy. We will take reasonable steps to correct any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, or out of date.

## Limits of Our Policy
Our website may link to external sites that are not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no control over the content and policies of those sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy practices. Additionally, through some of our services, such as our Discord bot, the method of access relies on a third party, who maintains their own privacy policy and data practices. Please review both this and their privacy policies to ensure your data is being used how you want it.

## Changes to This Policy
At our discretion, we may change our privacy policy to reflect updates to our business processes, current acceptable practices, or legislative or regulatory changes. If we decide to change this privacy policy, we will post the changes here at the same link by which you are accessing this privacy policy.
